This plugins implements a interface to Open Objects OpenErp data model. The Open Object
model is accessible using local classes (that extends GrailsDomainClass form Gorm) and
implements the default methods of Grom.
Behind the scene, the XML-RPC Open Object Interface is used to get the meta info for class
configuration (injecting properties and methods) and to get the data to populate the objects
returned from find*, get and criteria methods.
